Established in 2013, the Smart Sense Lab has made significant contributions to video analysis, computer forensics, and biometrics, exploring various artificial intelligence techniques. With over 8 million reais in funding from R&D projects in partnership with companies and research agencies in Brazil, the lab has published numerous projects and scientific articles. These projects enhance the integration between academic research and industrial demands, translating research findings into innovative Artificial Intelligence solutions. We develop solutions covering data capture, predictive model training and validation, including facial identification and verification, people and object detection, activity recognition, license plate recognition, and active camera control. Leveraging established techniques and scientific research, we also offer customized solutions tailored to specific requirements.
