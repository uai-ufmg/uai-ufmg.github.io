      title: Fourth Workshop of the GoDeep project.
      text: '<p>The fourth workshop of the Geoscience Oriented Deep Learning (GoDeep) project took place on March 19 and 20, 2025. The workshop is part of the cooperation agreement between DCC/UFMG and Petrobras, as part of the GoDeep - Geoscience Oriented Deep Learning project. During the two-day event, the results achieved so far were presented, in addition to knowledge exchange and discussions about the project.'

      title: Third Workshop of the GoDeep project.
      text: '<p>We held our third workshop for the Geoscience Oriented Deep Learning (GoDeep) project in August/24 for the delivery of Stage 4.
      A cooperation agreement between Petrobras and the Uncertainty Artificial Intelligence (LabUAI) laboratory - DCC/UFMG, which focuses on improving machine learning models applied to geological processing.
      There were 3 days of many presentations, discussions, a lot of learning and planning for the next 2 years of the project.'

      title: GoDeep team visits CENPES and Petrobras.
      text: '<p>In February 2024, the team represented by professors Flavio, Renato and Pedro (DCC), Alexei (PUC-MG) and Patr√≠cia (GP GoDeep) were at Petrobras headquarters and at CENPES. During the three days they were there, the professors and students participated, remotely and in person, in meetings to discuss technical and managerial issues within the scope of the project, which aims to use AI techniques, in particular Deep Learning, to advance the interpretation of data of interest to Petrobras.'

      title: DCC team promotes workshop for Petrobras professionals.
      text: '<p>The workshop on aligning themes, expectations and logistics of the Geoscience Oriented Deep Learning (GoDeep) project ended this Thursday (08/10/23). The project, in partnership with Petrobras, seeks to improve deep learning models to solve problems in the geosciences. From a computational point of view, the project focuses on the application of machine learning models to complex data such as images and time series. For the geosciences, such models are useful in oil exploration using seismic images, facile images and well mining data.
      The meeting lasted three days, with each of the three lines of the project talking about: (1) results achieved so far; (2) current research fronts; (3) expectations of DCC/UFMG; (4) expectations of Petrobras. On the second day, discussion groups were held based on items (3) and (4) above, with one group per line, each group in a room. The working groups then discussed the alignment between DCC/UFMG and Petrobras in the short and medium term. Finally, on the third day, logistical issues were discussed.'
