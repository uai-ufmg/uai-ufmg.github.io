      subtitle:
      text: '<p>Samarco selected 16 employees from different areas to make up the first Data Science Residency class, in partnership with the Computer Science Department at UFMG. On March 3, 2023, these professionals completed this stage, where they delved deeper, applied knowledge and developed models and prototypes of solutions with great potential to create value for the business.

      The main objective of the program was to enhance the development of Data Science, an unavoidable opportunity for the mining industry.

      
      Melissa Cangussu Vianna is a Strategic Marketing Analyst at the company and loved participating in the program. “It was a great experience, as it allowed the knowledge of UFMG tutors and professors to join our daily practice here at Samarco.”

      
      The Business Development and Innovation Manager, Bruno S. Pimentel, reinforces that “the Program brings an innovative format for learning and applying critical knowledge to Samarco”. According to him, “the partnership with one of the best Computer Science schools in Brazil makes all the difference.”

      
      This is yet another initiative that is part of the Movement for Innovation, an initiative that reinforces the company’s mobilization to advance its mining purpose in a different, more sustainable and safer way.'

      title: Usiminas Data science residency
      subtitle:
      text: '<p>Thinking about expanding the knowledge of its employees, Usiminas carried out mentoring with professionals from the Federal University of Minas Gerais, one of the references in data science in the country. The initiative was the result of a partnership between Universidade Corporativa Usiminas, IT Directorate and UFMG.


      The program, which lasted one year, covered theory and practice to develop and improve work processes at Usiminas. Giselle Miranda Bento, coordinator of the Center of Excellence in Analytics at Usiminas, highlights the importance of the mentoring project and encouraging data culture. “With new technologies, we have much more data in circulation and it is very important to understand it. The world of data science is no longer exclusive to the technical IT landscape or a data team. Data literacy is a great asset for Usiminas, we want our employees to be able to visualize opportunities within their areas and propose solutions”, she concludes.'
