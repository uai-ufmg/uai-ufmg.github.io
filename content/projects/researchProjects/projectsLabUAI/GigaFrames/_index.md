      title: GigaFrames | Large-Scale Surveillance and Computer Forensics
      subtitle: 2015 - Now
      text: <p>Over the last few years, more and more cameras have been used to monitor large cities. If, on the one hand, surveillance cameras provide a large amount of visual data, on the other hand, analyzing this data becomes a great challenge when done manually. In this way, the automatic processing of this data becomes essential, in order to assist security agents in preventing crimes (surveillance) and searching for evidence in cases where crimes have already occurred (forensic computing). Therefore, the moment in time when an event occurs (for example, a crime) marks an important connection between the two areas. This project's main objective is to implement and consolidate an emerging nucleus characterized by the creation of a line of research called Surveillance and Forensic Computing. This line, unprecedented in Brazil and formed by researchers from UFMG, UFOP and UNICAMP, will focus on the development of computer vision and machine learning techniques to carry out environmental monitoring and digital forensic analysis from large volumes of data captured through cameras surveillance. Made up of six researchers from the three institutions, the team has two CNPq level 2 productivity researchers. Although young doctors, the team members coordinate projects promoted by government agencies and companies, and have published in the main conferences and journals in the area. Additionally, there is an extensive history of collaboration between team members, both in the area of ​​surveillance and computer forensics.
