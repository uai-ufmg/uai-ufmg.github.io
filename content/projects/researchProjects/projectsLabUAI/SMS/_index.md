      title: SMS | Research and Development of an Intelligent Surveillance System Applied to Oil Platforms
      subtitle: 2018 - 2021
      text: <p>This project has two objectives. i) the study, development and evaluation of algorithms to be incorporated into the prototype surveillance system capable of automatically analyzing video and ii) creation, development, implementation and experimental validation of a prototype intelligent surveillance system capable of monitoring workers in regions of the oil exploration platform using visual data. This system will be able to issue alerts in cases of lack of mandatory safety equipment or obstruction of escape routes, in addition to being able to individually identify oil platform workers.
    design:
      # See Page Builder docs for all section customization options.
      # Choose how many columns the section has. Valid values: '1' or '2'.
