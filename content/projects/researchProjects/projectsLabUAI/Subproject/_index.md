        <p>Subproject 37 has the general objective of studying and identifying the likely impacts on the health of populations affected by the environmental disaster of the collapse of the C처rrego do Feij찾o dam, in Brumadinho. The subproject will describe patterns and trends in the epidemiological profile of morbidity and mortality of the population of the municipalities affected by the rupture and control municipalities located in their surroundings, based on the collection of secondary data in the period from 2010 to 2019. In addition, the subproject will evaluate the pattern and geographic dispersion of morbidity and mortality in the period and investigate associations of demographic, socioeconomic and environmental factors with morbidity and mortality indicators in the affected and control municipalities.
