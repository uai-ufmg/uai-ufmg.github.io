      title: Making Sense |  Robust Approaches to Visual Monitoring
      subtitle: 2019 - Now
      text: <p>One of the main objectives of automatic environmental monitoring is to extract information about activities performed by humans in order to detect interactions between agents and identify patterns of behavior that are suspicious. For activities to be analyzed, a set of problems, such as detection and identification of agents on the scene, tracking over time, possibly between different cameras, recognition of individual actions, needs to be resolved. Such problems make up the application domain called people observation, responsible for analyzing images and videos containing humans.
