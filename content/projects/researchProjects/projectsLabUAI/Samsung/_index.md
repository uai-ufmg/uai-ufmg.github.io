      title: Samsung | Video Recognition Method Capable of Encoding Temporal and Spatial Relations of Concepts Using Contextual Information
      subtitle: 2019 - Now
      text: <p>The proposed invention aims to encode contextual information for video analysis and understanding by encoding spatial and temporal relationships of objects and the main agent in a scene. The main target application of the invention is the recognition of human activity. Encoding these spatial and temporal relationships can be crucial for distinguishing different categories of human activities and can be important in helping to discriminate between different video categories for video classification, retrieval, categorization, and other video analysis applications.
