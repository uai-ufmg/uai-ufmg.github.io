      text: <p>In this project, visual data captured from environmental monitoring cameras will be used as input for analysis modules (solutions based on computer vision and machine learning to be developed). All solutions will be implemented on embedded devices with little computational power and, therefore, requiring research aimed at compressing deep models.
    design:
      # See Page Builder docs for all section customization options.
      # Choose how many columns the section has. Valid values: '1' or '2'.
